# library_database

This Python code uses various libraries to generate fictional data related to a bookstore. It includes multiple functions that create data for books, employees, contracts, clients, attendance, sales, payments, orders, and suppliers, utilizing the Faker library to simulate realistic information in Spanish (Chile). Each entity has a unique identifier, generated with a prefix and a counter, ensuring no duplicates. Details such as book titles, employee information, work hours, and attendance statuses are included. It also handles calculations for salary payments, including incentives for sellers based on their performance. Finally, the generated data is stored in pandas DataFrames and exported to CSV files, allowing for later use. This approach is useful for system testing, simulations, and application development without the need for real data.
